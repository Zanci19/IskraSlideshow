A slideshow made for school, displaying forecast, meals, and their news.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: With Dynamic Meal Updates (Recommended)
Run the built-in server to get real-time meals from eAsistent API:
```bash
node server.js
```
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

See [README-SERVER.md](README-SERVER.md) for setup instructions.

### Option 2: Static Files Only
Simply open `index.html` in your browser. Uses embedded meal data.

For automatic updates, see [README-MEALS.md](README-MEALS.md) and [README-USAGE.md](README-USAGE.md).
